/**
 * gamepad_buttons.h — Button INDICES of the SDL_GameController layout.
 *
 * Distinct from pad_bits.h, and the two are easy to confuse: pad_bits.h names
 * the BITS of the 16-bit gameplay input word, this names the button-index space
 * those bits are looked up BY. The pairing is
 *
 *     pad bits = g_joystickConfigWords[button index]
 *
 * or, for indices below JOY_SLOT_CFG_WORDS, the per-slot copy at
 * g_joystickSlots[slot][0x104 + index * 2] that the remap UI writes.
 *
 * Values are the SDL_CONTROLLER_BUTTON_* ordinals, restated here as plain
 * integers so init.c can lay out the defaults without pulling in SDL.h.
 * platform_sdl.c static_asserts them against the real enum, so if SDL ever
 * renumbers, the build breaks instead of the mapping silently shifting.

/* SDL's own enum continues past the d-pad with MISC1, four paddles and a

 * paddle — so index 15 onward is ours to define, and the two rear triggers live
 * there. SDL reports triggers as analog AXES with no button index of their own;
 * the poller thresholds them into these indices so they carry ordinary bindings
 * like any button. Ending the borrowed range at the d-pad also keeps these
 * indices stable across SDL versions, which kept adding to the tail. */

/* Per-slot binding capacity. g_joystickSlots[slot] is 0x11A bytes: device name

 * at 0x118. Ten is therefore a hard ceiling on per-pad bindings — indices at or
 * above it fall back to the shared g_joystickConfigWords[] and so are identical
 * for all four players. Raising it would change the on-disk JOYSTICK.INF layout
 * and the Dreamcast's VMU SONICR_PAD blob with it.
 *
 * It doubles as the remap UI's scan bound (published via
 * g_joystickDeviceFlags[] → slot[0x118] → ScanKeyRemap): a button the commit
 * cannot store must not be capturable, or it consumes one of the six action
 * prompts and binds nothing. Keeping the bound at ten also keeps ScanKeyRemap's
 * writes inside its 16-entry g_optKeyRemapResult / s_remapMappedFlag arrays,
 * which GC_BUTTON_COUNT on its own would overrun. */
